Primal Zodiac Calculator App; with a database containing eastern ,western zodiacs and 144 possible primal zodiacs. Based on your birth date our calculator takes your western zodiac and your eastern zodiac returning an output of your destined primal zodiac,  

Your Primal Zodiac Sign symbolises your instinctive animal nature. It simply displays to you which animal you are most like. Some think that you were this animal in a former life, while others believe that this animal functions as a spirit guide or animal spirit. Everyone has one, but if you don't know what it is, input your name and birth details in the form provided  to find out.
