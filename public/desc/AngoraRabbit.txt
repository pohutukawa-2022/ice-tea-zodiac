Charming, friendly, and somewhat mysterious, this is a sign that others are intrigued by. Maybe it’s because members of this sign can be hard to figure out. In truth, Angora Rabbits are a bit of a contradiction. They have big personalities, strong leadership qualities, and an undying drive for success, but at the same time they tend to come across as reserved, delicate, and sensitive. They hate conflict but they won’t back down if they believe in something. They are most powerful when balanced but often put themselves through long stretches of unbalanced behavior.



Make no mistake about them - Angora Rabbits want what they want, and they will get it one way or another. Rather than being forceful or aggressive, they are more likely to subtly charm their way to their goals. They have an uncanny ability to get others to listen to them and do things for them. Maybe it’s their calm confidence that convinces others that they know exactly what they are doing, even if they are making it up as they go. In truth, Angora Rabbits can be self-centered. Though they genuinely care about those around them, they tend to be more concerned with how they look at any given time than what is going on around them. To be fair, they are usually known for their excellent (if not somewhat eccentric) taste, and go through quite a bit of effort to maintain this reputation.

In the animal kingdom, angora rabbits are best known for their big, wild, unruly or otherwise unusual hair. It’s interesting to note how many well-known people born under the sign of the Angora Rabbit are associated with their hair as well (e.g. Tori Amos, John Stamos, Whitney Houston, James Hetfield, Coolio, Lynda Carter, “Alfalfa” from The Little Rascals). While not everyone born under this sign has memorable hair, most Angora Rabbits have something special about them that is hard to ignore.
