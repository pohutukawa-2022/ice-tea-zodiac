Though primarily solitary and even-keeled, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of Black Bear can be seriously dangerous if crossed. Like their animal namesake they are powerful and territorial creatures, though they have little desire to be part of any confrontation. They will, however, defend their territory fearlessly and relentlessly if provoked. Despite this, Black Bears are actually quite well natured most of the time, and are willing to work hard to finish whatever job needs done. They are also giving by nature, except when they feel that they may be in danger of losing stability in their own lives. Black Bears know that they can’t possibly help others if their own lives are unstable.

Black Bears don’t like to show their emotions, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have strong feelings about a great many things. One of their more challenging personality traits is their need to be in control of every situation that affects them. Unlike some other signs, they don’t need to be in control of others, just themselves. Black Bears know that they are hard working and capable, so they resent being supervised or managed by others who are usually less hard working and less capable than they are. They are more than willing to manage their own stability, and feel off balance if they can’t control the direction of their daily lives.
