Those born under the sign of the Camel are friendly, amiable, and up for an adventure. Like their animal namesake, Camels will not only trek through harsh conditions for you, they will carry you on their back while they do it. Few signs are as determined as this one once they know what they want. The nice thing is that what they usually want most is to take things as they come and have a good time while they do it. Members of this sign never try to impress others, but they often do so anyway through their natural charisma and easy-going personality. They are highly self-reliant and very lucky, which is why they donâ€™t always look before they leap.

Camels are not overly emotional. They like to live and let live. They are optimistic and believe that people are inherently good and kind and fair. Some people think that Camels are naive, and in some ways they are, but they are also very resilient and can bounce back from bad situations with ease and grace. This is a sign that lives for new experiences and would rather risk looking like a sucker every once in a while than risk missing out on an adventure. Besides, if things take a turn for the worse, Camels know that they can handle any situation they find themselves in.
