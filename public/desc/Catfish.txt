Catfish are complex and somewhat mysterious creatures. Far more than most people, those born under the sign of Catfish will experience strong inner conflict during their lifetimes. That’s because Catfish have two very different sides of their personality that are difficult to get in sync with each other. They are simultaneously strongly masculine and feminine, aggressive yet sweet, and active yet lazy.

Members of this sign somewhat resemble a hyperactive child. They mean well and truly care about those around them, but sometimes they can’t help but act out. They are genuinely kind and caring but have a tendency to say the wrong thing and offend others. Being a Catfish can be frustrating, as their actions don’t always match their intentions. Though typically social, in these difficult moments, members of the Catfish Primal Zodiac sign will head off on their own. Like their animal namesake, it’s as if they will sink if they don’t keep moving forward, looking for a place where they finally feel comfortable.



Catfish are sensitive, and when their lives are out of order, they can be very emotionally unstable. They often show a false sense of confidence to others, because they care very much how they are perceived. Internally they are unsure of what direction to take with their lives, but are unstoppably driven to keep moving forward. The key to happiness for this sign is to learn to relax and allow life to happen as it will. It will be very hard for them to give up control, but if they do, they will find that life is actually much more simple than they ever imagined.
