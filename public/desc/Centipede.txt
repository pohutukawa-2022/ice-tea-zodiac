Centipedes are sweet, caring, and always know the right thing to say. They are always pointing others toward the positives in life, though they themselves are prone to anxiety and depression. While they don’t care if they look tough or not, Centipedes hate to look weak, afflicted, or in any other way not living the perfect life. They try very hard to be there for others, but hate to ask for help when they need it.

Members of this sign are not great with money, though they always seem to acquire it when they really need it. Centipedes like to own nice clothes, cars, and homes and don’t mind spending the money to do so. They are smart and often go far in education, but they can be a little scatterbrained at times. While Centipedes are very caring and involved with friends and family they can also become resentful if this caring becomes expected of them. They like to give of themselves as a gift to others but don’t feel comfortable having others rely on them.
