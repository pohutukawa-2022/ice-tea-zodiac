Creative, intelligent, and curious, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Cheetah are a rare breed who have the capacity for high levels of both artistic and mathematical skill. Thus, they are often interested at an early age in esoteric or unexplained mysteries of the world. Their questioning of everything sparks an early learning curve, and most adults will perceive them as gifted. As kids, they often find themselves preferring the company of adults to other children.

Like their animal namesake, though, those born under the sign of the Cheetah are quick to get going in life, but have a harder time staying ahead in the long run. Like the wild cat they often end up solitary and territorial, working on what interests them and only allowing a few select others into their world. Like all cats, they love luxury and pleasure and have an instinctive fight-or-flight reaction to challenges. They often isolate themselves in order to pursue their individual interests, but a lack of socialization can alter their personalities in unexpected ways.



Cheetahs are affectionate, versatile, intuitive, observant, and receptive to new ideas (as long as they don’t contradict preconceived notions). This is a sign of deep thinkers with epic problem solving abilities. Both artsy and intellectual, they often feel misunderstood by their peers and society in general. Cheetahs question everything around them rather than simply accepting things as they are. Too often, though, they forget to question or analyze their own behaviors.

Despite a somewhat territorial nature, Cheetahs are sensitive individuals who prefer to avoid conflicts whenever possible. They have many positive traits, but they can also be judgmental, easily distracted, and socially unaware. They don’t have much of a middle-ground, and are often either “on” or “off”, meaning either funny, confident, and clever or depressed, self-victimized, and emotionally unstable.
