Social, courageous, and unpredictable, those born under the sign of Chimpanzee are always looking for new experiences. This is a passionate but restless sign that relies on their own community or network of acquaintances to help them through life. In return, members of this sign provide charm, wit, passion, and communication to those around them. Their contributions may not be as obvious or straightforward as those of their peers, but when they are gone the community can easily notice the difference.

Chimpanzees are emotional and often guide themselves by their instincts rather than logic. They have little interest in doing things the way that others have done them in the past and are constantly on the lookout for new ideas. Members of this sign have a reputation for being impatient and indecisive. They often spread themselves too thin, trying to take on many tasks at once. This carries over into their social lives where others have a hard time getting their attention on a regular basis. Chimpanzees are always on the move and always looking for their next obsession.

Some may think that members of this sign are self-centered, but it would be more correct to call them self-focused. They make contributions to their environment in subtle ways, and can be very influential among their communities. However, they tend to do everything with a focus on how it can benefit them. Luckily Chimpanzees are fairly idealistic and humanitarian, so what benefits them usually ends up benefiting others as well.
