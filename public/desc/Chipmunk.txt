Those born under the sign of the Chipmunk are restless, self-reliant, and expressive. They value honesty and integrity in others and are quick to judge those who donâ€™t live up to their expectations. Members of this sign require social interaction with others who can keep up with their active minds, which can be challenging to find. They tend to be opinionated and like to gossip about others, but simultaneously have a deep fear of being judged by others.

Chipmunks have an easy time making money and an even easier time spending it. For all of their success, they end up having little to show for it as they are constantly buying new toys, gadgets, and clothes. The curious Chipmunk gets excited by new releases of movies, music, books, and technology. Living in and enjoying the current moment is more important to them than thinking about the future, which can have good and bad effects. On the bright side they tend to enjoy their lives more than their stressed-out peers, but their impulsive nature can also lead them to make poor decisions in regards to their health, personal relationships, and bank accounts.
