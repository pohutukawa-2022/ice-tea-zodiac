Peaceful, creative, and elegant, those born under the sign of the Clownfish are not clowns at all, but arbiters of good taste amongst their acquaintances. Like their animal namesake, members of this sign like to keep up a clean, sophisticated appearance. They are almost always well dressed and have nice homes and gardens with perfectly staged furniture and artwork. Even young Clownfish with little money like to save up to buy nice things.

While members of this sign are always polite and well-mannered, they tend to have a good deal of social anxiety. In truth, Clownfish are insecure. They too often need the love and approval of others to feel good about themselves. They don’t like to take risks because they don’t want to make mistakes and offend others or embarrass themselves. Instead, many Clownfish are content with trying to quietly go with the flow, focusing their energy on being admired by others.



Clownfish don’t try to control other people, so they often instead try to control everything in their lives, which is why their homes, cars, and wardrobes are always so immaculate. Members of this sign aren’t superficial, but can become so if they focus all of their attention on material things. It’s not that they are materialistic necessarily; Clownfish are just very, very big dreamers. They love to fantasize about the perfect life and aspire to somehow have it all, despite the fact that they are not go-getters by nature.

Those born under this sign have a couple of key challenges in their lives. First, they must learn to accept reality in order to avoid being constantly disappointed by life. In addition, they don’t trust their instincts enough and tend to therefore get suckered into situations they don’t want to be in. Clownfish are highly intelligent and creative and should trust themselves to be more independent.
