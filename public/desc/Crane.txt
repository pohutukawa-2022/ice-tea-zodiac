Graceful, generous, and friendly, those born under the sign of the Crane are romantic dreamers to whom reality seems a dull chore. Cranes have big hopes and dreams for the future and believe that love can indeed conquer all. Though others may see them as unrealistic, members of this sign believe that life can be whatever they choose. They are enchanted by love, adventure, and excitement, but are usually too scared to take any real risks in life.

Typically Cranes prefer to become involved in the lives of others rather than strike out on their own. They are great listeners and loyal friends who value their personal relationships more than anything else. That said, Cranes also have great taste and have a deep admiration for luxurious things. They will often host lavish parties or events just to make others feel good, though they also have a tendency to take on too many social responsibilities, which they have a very hard time saying “no” to.



Cranes want life to be perfectly perfect, but deep down they know that life has its ups and downs. Members of this sign are among the best to have around for the ups, but are not particularly skilled at dealing with the downs. Deep down, Cranes are insecure and rely heavily on others to build their self-esteem. They believe strongly in treating others as they would like to be treated, but are often disappointed that nobody can match their impressive social efforts. This may leave Cranes feeling unappreciated and without the admiration and affection they feel they deserve.

If there is one thing that truly gets the core of a Crane is injustice. They can’t stand the thought of life being unfair and subconsciously base a lot of their decisions on the idea that they will get ahead in life by simply being a “good person”. When this doesn’t work out, they often become sullen, depressed, and lost in the world. Cranes need to understand that life, and the people in it, are not perfect, and that they don’t have to be either.
