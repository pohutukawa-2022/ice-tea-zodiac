Like their animal namesake, people born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Cricket seem like they never sleep. Though this is obviously not true, this sign has a mind that doesn’t shut off easily. Any Cricket will tell you that most of their best ideas come to them right before they drift off to sleep. These ideas are often so exciting that the Cricket has to get up and write it down or work on a solution immediately. They are prone to staying up late, though they are often working on a project rather than simply goofing around.

Crickets are intellectuals who like to explore and experiment with new ideas and theories. Unlike similarly intellectual signs, like the Seal, members of this sign are very polite in social situations and like nothing more than getting into a theoretical discussion about something scientific or otherwise cerebral. For this reason, this sign is often that of self-proclaimed “nerds”, but most Crickets are simply too likable for such a derisive label. That said, don’t be surprised at all to find a member of this sign fascinated by science fiction, fantasy, or astronomy. If anyone you know is going to be able to recite the Starfleet Academy’s motto in perfect Klingon and simultaneously know how uncool it is to do so - that person is very likely a Cricket.
