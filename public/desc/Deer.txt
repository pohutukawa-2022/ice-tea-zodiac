Those born under the sign of the Deer are kind, loyal, and intensely curious. The Deer is the biggest gossip of the Primal Zodiac - they love to talk about everyone and everything that is going on around them. They have no ill will in spreading rumors, they simply love to share the latest news with everyone possible. This sometimes gets them into trouble with more private types, but if this happens Deers will stop at nothing to make things right. They highly value friendship and loyalty and will do what it takes to right any wrongs that they can.

Deers are very intelligent and quick witted. They are extremely curious and love to know how things work. They have the ability to master new skills quickly, but they also tend to move on to new projects once they have tired of a previous one. Patience is not their strongest virtue and they have a tendency to worry excessively about things that they have no control or influence over. A fast-moving mind in combination with an inclination for anxiety can be a dangerous cocktail, and when taken to the extreme can turn overly stressed Deers into conspiracy theorists and paranoid neurotics.

On a normal day this is a very amiable sign that is a tad on the pessimistic side. Deers must be careful to keep an open mind as they explore life as they have a tendency to get very focused on certain facts and figures that can unintentionally skew the way they see the world. Even dogmatic Deers, though, have good intentions at heart and truly want most to make a positive contribution to the lives of others.
