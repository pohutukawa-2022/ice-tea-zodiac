Much like their animal namesake, members of the Doberman Pinscher sign are something of a contradiction. They can be dominant and aggressive one minute, then insecure and anxious the next. Dobermans are very focused individuals. Once they decide what they want, there is no stopping them. The only downside is that they donâ€™t plan very well, and their impulsive actions can get them in trouble. They rarely worry about this, though, as they have a way of bouncing back from most bad situations.

Dobermans have trust issues that stem from their own naivety. They are consistently wary of what to trust because they have a tendency to believe anything they are told. Members of this sign are typically outgoing and adventurous, and think that everyone should be. They enjoy taking others with them on their adventures, acting as guide and helper, hoping and expecting that everyone else will enjoy it as much as they do.
