Despite the name, people born under the sign of the Dodo are actually quite intelligent and have a thirst for learning new things. They have a childlike energy and though well-mannered can be a bit hyperactive at times. Like a child, they are infinitely curious and want to know everything about everything.

Like the now-extinct bird, members of the Dodo sign tend to be very naive, believing just about anything they are told. This comes from their trusting nature and assumption that people are always going to be nice and do the right thing. Luckily, they are also fairly resilient, and have a naturally positive outlook that helps them bounce back from disappointments.

Dodos have a “thirst for life” and love to chase new experiences, from climbing a mountain to tasting exotic food from a distant land. They are typically happy and energetic, but when they are down they can show a distinctly different side which will surprise those who know them. They can be angry, aggressive, judgmental and self-destructive. As long as they don’t stay in these moods for too long they should be able to live a fairly well balanced life.
