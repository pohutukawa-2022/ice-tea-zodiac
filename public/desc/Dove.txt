Independent, energetic, and adventurous, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Dove love life and long for new experiences. Members of this sign are always looking forward; they rarely dwell on the past. Doves are often restless, which can lead them to take risks in life. They are also lucky, though, so most of the time everything works out just fine.

To be fair, Doves probably just seem lucky because they are so optimistic. Even when they are feeling down, those born under this sign always manage to get back on track. They believe that they can have whatever they want if they work hard for it, and they are almost always right. Excellent at learning new things, there are very few tasks that Doves do not excel at. For them, the greatest challenge is not taking on a new enterprise, but staying interested long enough to finish it!

Always focused on what’s coming up around the corner, Doves have a hard time living in the moment. They have tons of energy and never want to stop moving, which ironically causes them to miss out on many of life’s more subtle experiences. Those born under this sign will have to find a way to slow themselves down long enough to smell the roses every once in a while or they risk running straight through life like it was a race. If it was a race, though, they would be certain to win.
