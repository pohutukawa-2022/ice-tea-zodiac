Those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Duck are kind, caring, and generous, but also hide a deeper emotional side that they don’t bring out often. Members of this sign are more concerned with making others feel comfortable than being comfortable themselves. They are concerned about their appearance and how others view them, but they try not to show it. Ducks are great with children and animals and tend to believe that whatever they give to the world they will get back.

There is a darker side to the Duck, though. If you were able to look deep inside them (which they would never let you do) you would find that beneath their kind and tempered exterior is a fragile, emotional artist. Because they don’t like to share their feelings all that much, you might never know this about a Duck, even one that is close to you. All members of this sign have an artistic talent and a need to express themselves. Surprisingly though, you won’t find a lot of Ducks as professional artists - they like to keep this secret for themselves and often only express their artistic side when they are alone.
