There are few signs kinder than the Earthworm. Members of this sign are known for their compassion and sincerity. Despite their kind nature, Earthworms wonâ€™t let just anyone into their world.

Earthworms feel most comfortable at home, and are often just fine daydreaming in silence by themselves, pondering the mysteries of life. They have a delicate nature that to many makes them seem fragile, but this is not the case. Earthworms are, in fact, quite resilient. They may bruise easily, but they rarely break.
