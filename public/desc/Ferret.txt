Those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Ferret are playful, fun-loving, and rambunctious. Members of this sign wear their hearts on their sleeves. You will always know what a Ferret is thinking or feeling. Thankfully they are usually in a good mood and tend to perceive life as a challenging game that they are eager to win.

As natural leaders with a creative intelligence to match their curiosity, they perform surprisingly well in the business world. Of course, they have to be interested in what they are doing for this to be true. Ferrets are known to quit jobs as soon as they become boring, but they are such great networkers that they can always find another one quickly.

Ferrets can be overly concerned with feeling good, which leads some people to think of them as self-centered. In truth, they are a bit too self-involved, but they are also a sign that cannot function when they are out of balance. A Ferret’s mood affects everyone around them, good or bad, so it’s better to give this sign what it needs to be happy.
