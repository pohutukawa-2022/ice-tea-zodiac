An intriguing combination of the sensitive and docile Pisces and the proud, powerful Dragon, one would expect those born under the sign of the Firefly to be more of a contradiction. In most cases, however, these two very different sets of personality traits work quite well together.

Firefly is the sign of the idealist. Creative, intuitive, and mysterious, Fireflies are passionate about what they believe in. They try hard to be optimists who want to see the world as a happy place where good things are supposed to happen to good people. They are warm and loyal friends, and will do anything to help a friend or family member in need. At the same time, they expect this loyalty to be returned and have little problem demanding it. Above all things, Fireflies want to be loved and admired.



Members of this sign may be prone to depression when inactive. With such strong ideals and a powerful sense of right and wrong, they are not well-suited to accepting things as they are. While such acceptance is often tied to the concept of realism, it just doesn’t seem to work well for their personalities. Fireflies in particular need to be forward thinking, forward moving. They need a heartfelt purpose in life and need to see progress toward it. Even if they can’t change the world, they can, and should, do their part to make it better.

Fireflies are sensitive. They spend a lot of time living in their own minds. In truth they prefer their perfect little fantasy worlds over reality, where they tend to feel a bit cheated by life. In their perfect world everyone is like them and their animal namesake - a small but potent light in the vast darkness.
