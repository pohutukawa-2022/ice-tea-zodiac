Intelligent, delicate, and well-mannered, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Flamingo are also some of the biggest dreamers in the world. This is one of the most creative signs there is, though even those closest to them may not know it. Flamingos tend to hide the majority of the truly fantastic ideas that exist in their minds, only sharing them when, and if, they finally feel confident enough to do so.

In fact, Flamingos keep a great deal of their thoughts inside. Perhaps this is because they live most of their lives inside their own minds. They are constantly running over different scenarios and plans in their minds, trying to figure out the best next move before they make it. Because of this, members of this sign tend to be worriers by nature. The amount of work they can do strictly in their heads can be exhausting, and the incredible potential of their ideas rarely sees fruition because of their indecisiveness and anxiety.

Those born under this sign have great style. They never like to leave the house without putting themselves together first. Even if this process takes hours, they make their look seem effortless. Presenting themselves well to others gives them a sense of control and helps offset the amount of chaos going on in their minds at any given time. If they could just focus their energy and trust their decisions, Flamingos could do amazing things.
