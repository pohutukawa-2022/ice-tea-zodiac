Those born under the sign of the Fox are elegant, charming, and impossible to ignore. Whether you love them or hate them, Foxes have a naturally ability to influence others without trying. Members of this sign are born leaders but are also extremely independent. They are wise and cunning, and don’t take risks until they have thoroughly evaluated the situation. Others know to follow a Fox’s lead even though Foxes rarely try to recruit followers.

Members of this sign have amazing intuition. Not only can they read social situations well, they also know exactly what other people want to hear. This is not to say that they are phony in any way. In fact, this is one of the most genuine signs you will ever meet. Rather, Foxes choose what to say and when to say it with great care. They never just blurt out what they are thinking except when they are around those they trust completely. Trust and betrayal are huge concerns of this sign - they are loyal and honest with those they care about and demand that this trust be returned. Ironically they are gifted liars - a trait that they only put to use when they deem it necessary.



Foxes are ambitious when it comes to what they want. They work and play exceptionally well, as long as the work and play interest them. Nothing is worse for this sign than being forced to do something they don’t like. In honesty, Foxes are only really interested in being comfortable, which usually means relaxing and talking with friends. They can only relax, however, when they feel that they are in control of their lives. If they are having financial, relationship, career, health, or any other challenges, they simply cannot rest until they’ve made things right. This trait helps them work hard to get to successful place in their lives, but it can also make them anxious and controlling when progress is happening too slowly for their liking.
