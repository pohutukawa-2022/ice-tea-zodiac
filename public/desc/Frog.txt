Mysterious, cerebral, and soft-spoken, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Frog are elusive charmers with excellent intuition. Their natural instincts are so good, in fact, that they can get further in life than most solely on their intuitive gifts. Frogs have big imaginations and like to think situations through long before they are ever encountered. They have strategic minds and can anticipate the moves of others before they happen. Like their animal namesakes, members of this sign then only have to sit and wait for their prey to come to them.

One of the hallmarks of this sign is that they are always surprising you. Depending on other positions in the birth chart, most Frogs will be naturally reserved when you first meet them then will suddenly say something extremely funny, charming, or observant that makes others wonder what else is hiding behind the cool exterior. Trying to get into the mind of a Frog is nearly impossible though, as they tend to be more manipulative of themselves than they are of other people. Frogs like to bend reality to fit their preferred model of the world, and as long as nothing comes along to contradict this belief, they can live in their invented reality for quite some time.

Frogs are notoriously elusive. They are polite, well mannered and have classic tastes - implying that they are more conservative than they really are. Since they rarely let anyone see the innerworkings of their own mental world, others have an increasingly difficult time getting to know them the further into their minds they try to delve. There are many species of frogs in the animal kingdom, from the common “water frog” to the brightly colored and toxic “poison dart frog”. Similarly, planetary relationships in the birth chart have a strong effect on the personality characteristics of someone born under the sign of the Frog.
