hose born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Giraffe are unique, vibrant, and surprisingly delicate inside. A combination of the Tropical Sun sign of Virgo and the Chinese Zodiac’s sign of the Horse, members of this sign present two sets of personality traits that can be either complementary or contradictory. Virgo keeps the impatient Horse focused while the Horse brings out Virgo’s deep-seeded passion. When balanced correctly, these two very different personalities merge into an unstoppable powerhouse, capable of dreaming up and accomplishing the most amazing things. When unbalanced, though, they can easily spiral out of control. At their worst they can be bossy, hyper-critical, and inflexible. Deep down, many Giraffes lack true confidence in themselves and their quest to achieve great things can make them appear to others as self-involved and egotistical.

Giraffes are adventurous. They love to travel, but unlike many other signs, their primary goal is not for rest and relaxation. More than anything, they long for new experiences and believe that these experience help them to evolve. Members of this sign are naturally rebellious. They have a hard time relaxing and letting go without the use of alcohol or other drugs. Most need regular exercise to calm both the body and the mind.

Above all else, those born under this sign are resilient. Though they are somewhat sensitive, they can start over many times and will always be okay. They realize that life is a journey and they treasure each experience that gets them closer to what they want.
