One thing that will never be said about an Goldfinch is that they lack self-confidence. Members of this Primal Zodiac sign are overflowing with confidence, a trait that helps them succeed far beyond anyone else’s expectations. There is a mysterious power in these people that stems from their firm self-belief. It’s even said in ancient mythology that the evil and powerful half-bird/half-women creatures, the Harpies, feared the Goldfinch for what they might be able to do.

Goldfinches are great at making friends and love being part of social situations. They are highly active and energetic, which sometimes plays at odds with their tendency to want things organized and clean. Members of this sign expect things to go their way, and because of this, they often do. When they don’t get their way, their dark side comes out and they become selfish, arrogant, bossy, and aggressive. Goldfinches don’t worry much about other people’s feelings, so getting them back on course is difficult. Luckily, the Goldfinch likes to feel good, so they won’t stay in a funk for long.
