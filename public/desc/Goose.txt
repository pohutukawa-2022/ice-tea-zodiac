In the animal kingdom, there are primarily two categories of geese: wild and domesticated. Wild geese go where they want when they want, while domesticated geese lay far more eggs and guard them more ferociously. In the Primal Zodiac, those born under the sign of the Goose have both sides blended into one.

Members of this sign are diplomatic, multi-faceted, and strong willed. As they get older Geese are likely to be very family-oriented and domesticated, while younger Geese are likely to showcase a more wild side. Those who donâ€™t let loose in their youth may find themselves restless for adventure and experiences down the road. Before they can settle down, Geese need to experience independence, at the very least. Indeed the two contradictory personality aspects are often at war with one another inside the mind of a Goose.



Those born under the sign of the Goose have a quiet power about them. Even at their most gentle and reserved there is an underlying silent strength that can be felt from them. Many people assume that Geese have an unwavering self-confidence, but in reality this is a complex sign which vacillates between certainty and doubt on a regular basis. Regardless, they have a drive that continues to push them forward, without which they might mire in anxiety and confusion for far too long.

Geese, in their more mature years, tend to be appreciative of everything around them. Of course they still dream of romance and adventure, but over time they learn to accept that life has its ups and downs and at best can find peace and contentment while still enjoying life. Balance is the key for Geese, as is acceptance. Enjoying life for what it is and not for what it could be should be the goal of any mature Goose. Young Geese should not worry about this just yet. Youth is the time for adventure and experience for this sign.
