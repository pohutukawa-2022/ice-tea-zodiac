In the animal kingdom, great white sharks must keep moving constantly or they will suffocate and die. This is an apt metaphor for people born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the same name. Members of this sign are the most restless of the Primal Zodiac and need a constant stream of new experiences to keep them mentally healthy. This is a very outgoing sign that never tires of new people, places, and adventures.

Great White Sharks are extremely social and love to talk almost as much as they love to be talked about. In truth, Great Whites are a bit self-centered and have little interest in subjects that don’t at least indirectly affect them. They don’t intend to be rude, it’s just that they have so many interests and such a lust for life that they don’t want to feel bogged down by anything outside of their immediate scope of thought. They do have tempers, though, which come out when they are either bored or not getting what they want. Great Whites can be downright mean spirited when they are having an “off” day. Luckily this doesn’t happen too often.

Members of this sign have a lot of hobbies, and need to regularly exercise both the body and the mind to stay balanced. More so than any other sign, Great White Sharks lose interest quickly in their pursuits and will ditch any project at any point in favor of whatever interests them more. They are more cunning than they are intelligent, which is why many of them end up doing well in school without really trying. Great White Sharks are always looking for corners to cut and steps to skip, and are usually able to do so successfully. Getting things done quickly is more important than getting them done right.
