It is said that if a shark stops moving they will drown. This is brilliant metaphor for the Hammerhead Shark Primal Zodiac sign. Hammerheads are headstrong, independent, and adventurous. They have seemingly endless amounts of energy and when they see something they want, they go after it full-force. Members of this sign can’t stand restrictions. Their independence is the most important thing. They have a hard time settling down in careers and relationships unless they have the freedom to do what they want when they want to do it.

From the outside Hammerheads seem very confident, but this is not actually the case. They wear a mask most of the time - showing people the face they want them to see, not who they really are. They don’t like to stop and think about things, they would much rather just push forward and see what happens. They tend to be a bit self-involved, and at their worst can be overly aggressive and blunt to the point of rudeness. Hammerheads like being around people and tend to do best in large groups.
