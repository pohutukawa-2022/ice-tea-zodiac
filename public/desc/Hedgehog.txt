Those born under the sign of the Hedgehog are friendly, reserved, stylish, and sensitive. Like their animal namesake they can be shy and defensive, especially in unfamiliar situations, but once they open up to you they are great friends to have around.

It usually takes a while to get to know a Hedgehog. It’s not because they are unfriendly or impolite - in fact they value manners and politeness very highly - it’s just that they don’t talk about themselves very much and tend to be very uncomfortable in unfamiliar places or with unfamiliar people. Those with the patience to get to know them on their terms will find them to be very warm, friendly, and well-mannered. They don’t like to say bad things about anyone, and equally don’t like bad things said about them. If you become very close friends with a Hedgehog you will find that they are welcoming hosts, engaging conversationalists, and imaginative thinkers with a lot more to say than one would expect.

Hedgehogs like to do things their own way and on their own terms. They are surprisingly stubborn and determined for having such an easygoing nature. They don’t need to brag about how good they are at something - they just go out and succeed. Hedgehogs have creative minds and are more ambitious than they appear. While others are out socializing, Hedgehogs often spend a lot of time on their own mastering their craft or learning a new skill.
