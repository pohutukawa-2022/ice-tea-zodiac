In the animal kingdom, a hermit crab constantly moves from shell to shell as it grows larger. Similarly, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of Hermit Crab regularly move between homes, jobs, and relationships. In their minds, Hermit Crabs believe they will finally settle down and feel comfortable once they find the perfect fit, yet the more they search the more unsettled they feel.

Hermit Crabs don’t desire to become rich and famous, instead they desire true love and adventure. This is a highly contradictory sign whose thoughts often don’t even make sense to themselves. Members of this sign have a hard time accepting things as they are, and though they talk a lot about how they are going to make things better, they often just move on instead. This sign lacks true confidence and has a tendency to put on a false front, hoping that others won’t realize how uncertain they are about themselves and the direction of their lives. Sometimes this mask takes the form of bravado and a “who cares” attitude.

Hermit Crabs like to pretend that they don’t care about much, as if caring were a sign of weakness, but in reality long for love and acceptance. They want to feel like they belong, but deep down they are also independent spirits who want their lives to be adventurous and meaningful. Emotional swings are not uncommon, nor is seeking the help of a therapist. Members of this sign need to learn how to accept life as it is and not try to control everything if they want to find balance and happiness in their lives.
