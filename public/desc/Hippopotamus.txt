It’s somewhat ironic to call this sign “Hippopotamus”, since a person’s initial reaction to finding out that this is their sign will be outrage. “I am not a hippopotamus! They are fat and lazy and way too passive! That’s not like me at all!” This just defines how misunderstood both the person and the animal really are.

The hippopotamus (the animal) is often portrayed as passive and sweet and fat and lazy, but in reality, they can be highly dangerous if you step into their territory uninvited. Grown hippos have canine teeth up to 20 inches long and can snap them down on opponents with the force of a sledgehammer. They are generally passive among their own, but can explode in an aggressive rage if pushed.

This sums up people born under the Primal Zodiac sign quite well. They are serious and forceful when necessary, but mostly they are just hard-working and goal-oriented. They house a lot of inner conflict, as they are simultaneously adventurous, ambitious, reserved, and focused. Hippos can be stubborn and judgmental, and though usually even keeled, can be impulsive when upset. Achieving balance should be the life goal of most members of this sign.
