In nature, hummingbirds move so fast that they seem to defy the laws of physics. This is an apt metaphor for the Primal Zodiac sign of Hummingbird - a sign whose members are constantly moving and darting from place to place. Those born under this sign are full of energy. They want to do everything and do it on a grand scale. When they come up with a goal, they immediately follow it, unconcerned with whether or not it is reasonable or even possible. To a Hummingbird, anything is possible, at least as long as they are the ones doing it.

It’s hard to get a member of this sign to change their mind. They are constantly thinking, constantly doing, and they have an enormous amount of self-confidence. Sometimes this can get them into trouble since they often leap before they look, but they are also a lucky sign whose unbridled belief in themselves causes most situations to work out in their favor. Hummingbirds need to be in control. They don’t like taking orders and usually decide to do things their own way no matter what the orders are. They also love to talk, and are often gossiping about others. This isn’t done to be rude, it’s just that the Hummingbird loves to be the one to get to share new information. Finding out through the grapevine is not their style.
