The Hyena is one of the most social signs of the Primal Zodiac. Like their animal namesake (particularly the spotted hyena or laughing hyena), members of this sign strongly prefer to spend time in large groups of friends and families. This is a very strong-willed sign with the ability to follow through on their promises and take what is theirs when necessary.

Those born under this sign are highly energetic and outgoing. They have an easy charm about them that draws other people in. Hyenas are great at taking charge of situations, and are by far most comfortable when they are in charge. While they are generally quite kind and thoughtful, they will stubbornly insist on things being done their way and expect others to follow. Luckily, others do tend to follow the leadership of this strong and intelligent sign who is more than capable of proving themselves worthy of the task.

The main weakness of Hyenas is their tendency to be self-centered. While they are highly likable and usually very friendly, they also expect to get what they want when they want it, and have been known to throw full-on tantrums when they don’t get their way. This behavior seems out of place for this sign, which usually gives off the impression that they are in full control of everything. Hyenas who don’t get their way get frustrated and this is when they will exit the social group and not return until they have fed their individual need (much like the spotted hyena who lives in groups but hunts alone.)
