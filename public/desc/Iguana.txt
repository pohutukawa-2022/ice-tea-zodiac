I have heard that it’s not uncommon among pet owners to think that their pet iguana hates them. Like their animal namesake, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of Iguana are equally hard to read. Chances are they don’t hate you at all; they are simply expressing their feelings without concern for the effect it has on others. That’s actually the easy thing about Iguanas - they will let you know exactly what’s on their mind at any given moment. This trait also causes the most problems for them, as they can easily offend others without trying and may not even realize the negative effect they can have on those around them if they don’t learn to keep themselves in check.

Yes, Iguanas are moody. They are also highly skeptical and don’t trust most things they hear right away, but that’s because they are also highly intuitive and have learned to follow their instincts over what they are told. They regularly let this intuition guide them, as well they should. Though they are typically smart, Iguanas will fare better in most of life’s challenges if they trust their gut over their thoughts.

Members of this sign care a lot about how others perceive them, which makes it hard to understand how they can blurt out insults without realizing their impact. Well-intentioned yet blunt, stoic yet overly emotional, stylish yet simple, this is indeed a sign of contradictions. In life Iguanas should learn to accept things as they are and not let their emotions get in the way of their intuitions. If they can calm down and find a balance in life, they have every chance at happiness.
