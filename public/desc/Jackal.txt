In the animal kingdom, jackals are often mistakenly thought of as lazy scavengers who don’t like to take risks or venture outside of their own territory. In the Primal Zodiac, those born under the sign of the Jackal are often misrepresented in the same way. To be fair, members of this sign don’t like to take risks, feel most comfortable on their own turf, and favor long-term survival over momentary satisfaction. But to consider these traits as negatives is to misunderstand the Jackal completely.

Jackals are notoriously hard to read. On the outside they often look bored, disinterested, and lazy. On the inside, however, they are constantly re-evaluating situations and making plans for the future. Jackals have a deep-seeded need for long-term security that heavily influences most of their behavior. To a member of this sign, being secure means being able to live day to day on autopilot - having a comfortable routine that they can change at their whim but will always be there for them to fall back on. They don’t mind living in squalor and eating scraps if it leads to an eventual reality of comfortable, if not extravagant living. In truth, Jackals desire the finest homes, possessions, food, and drink. Though they can be self-indulgent, they will never sacrifice their future security for momentary bliss. Everything Jackals do is in an attempt to realize the fantasy of being set comfortably for life.

Those born under this sign have a hard time living in the moment, and are prone to depression and sulking because their goal seems so far away. Jackals need to learn to take pleasure in each day and not just use it as a platform to get closer to their future. If they don’t, they risk missing out on their own lives as they are living them.
