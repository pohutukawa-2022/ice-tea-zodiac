In the animal kingdom, there are different kinds of jellyfish. Some live near the surface, having only rare interaction with the limited world within their reach. Some live in the deep sea, and these jellyfish are more quiet and submissive, but in the darkness that surrounds them they glow bright with radiant colors in a spectacular show that is unmatched in the animal kingdom. Some are even giants, slowly flowing through life on their own journey in their own time. All are so brilliantly mysterious that even defining them seems like a challenge.

Like their animal namesakes, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Jellyfish may sometimes strike out, but are typically quiet and keep to themselves. These are people who are deeply intellectual, swimming through the waters of their own mind, but cautious enough to warn outsiders not to get too close too quickly. For humans born under the sign of the Jellyfish, their sting is just a warning - don’t get too close unless you are willing to risk getting hurt.



Jellyfish are independent and instinctive, yet elegant and discrete. Everyone born under this sign has incredible intuition. They are not only excellent at logically dissecting and examining a situation but they also have a sort of “sixth sense” for understanding what is subconsciously driving certain people in certain directions. Members of this sign create their universe as they go. Their perception of “what is” is more important than what others, even experts, declare as truth. This brilliant and mysterious sign is known for their dedication to their own uniquely creative approach to life.

Many Jellyfish have sensitive stomachs and digestive systems and must pay close attention to the things they eat and drink and how it makes them feel. Because of this Jellyfish tend to be more focused on diet and nutrition than the average person. They also tend to be more sensitive to changes in the weather than usual.
