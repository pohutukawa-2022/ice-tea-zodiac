Those born under the sign of the Kangaroo can be difficult to figure out. On one hand they appear to be relatively friendly, hard-working individuals who work too much and are always focused on something else. Get in the way of their goals, though, and watch out. Few signs have the explosive temper of the Kangaroo. They don’t mean to offend, but the hot-headed and heavy-hearted Kangaroo lives in an inner world of extremes and has a hard time realizing that others don’t see everything that is going on behind their focused exterior. To this sign, life is a battle that must be won at all costs, and anyone not with them must be against them.

Members of this sign are obsessed with the future. More accurately, they are obsessed with their future success. Few signs are as determined as the Kangaroo. Once they have decided to achieve a goal they will pour themselves into the challenge, often working late into the night to follow through on an idea before it slips away.



Kangaroos are much more creative than they seem from the outside. The combination of innovative thinking and a stubborn yet passionate drive often overwhelms a Kangaroo’s senses. They have a hard time staying balanced between working and living, which they too often view as the same thing.

In truth, Kangaroos just want to be admired and appreciated. They know that few others are capable of matching their ambition and motivation, and since they appreciate these qualities more than any others they can’t understand why those around them don’t seem to acknowledge their efforts. These traits are indeed admirable and even impressive to some, but what Kangaroos fail to realize is that those close to them prefer the rare opportunity of having them present in the moment over getting to share in their future success.
