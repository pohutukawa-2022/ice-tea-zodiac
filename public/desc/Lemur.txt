Lemurs know how to express themselves. Their grasp of language is second to none and they can use this to get what they want in life. They aren’t particularly boisterous or loud (unless they’ve had a few drinks, then look out), but they know what to say and when to say it. Lemurs are also excellent writers. No matter what form or language they choose, this sign can always argue their point with grace and poise.

Perhaps because of this natural talent they can also be a bit manipulative. Lemurs are naturally deep thinkers, but they can be moody, and this combination can lead to imaginative fantasies about how others are doing them wrong or how they are not getting what they deserve in life. The side effect is often anger, jealousy and other unnecessary drama. Lemurs never forget a slight, and will plot their revenge for months, though they rarely actually act on these fantasies. More likely they will use their vast vocabulary to chastise their enemies with sharp words and scathing rebukes.

It’s true that Lemurs can be led to superficiality. All that strategizing and persuading their way into getting what they want can cause them to forget what’s really important in life. Luckily members of this sign are good at recognizing when they are out of balance and will usually disappear from acquaintances for a time until they can realign themselves.
