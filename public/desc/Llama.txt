Despite appearing quiet and easy-going, those born under the sign of the Llama are actually powerful, capable, and determined individuals. Llamas have no problem going with the flow as long as it works for them, but don’t even think about getting in their way if they want to make a change. These are the people that slowly and steadily move toward their goals, as if oblivious to the obstacles in the way. Of course, they see every obstacle, and may even suffer through anxiety and uncertainty along the way, but from the outside you would never know it. Inside there may be a whirlwind of thoughts and feelings, but nothing defines a Llama better than having a cool and calm exterior.

This is a sign that is always surprising you. They have unique ways of seeing the world and often have big dreams to go along with their unique perspectives. It’s as if they were born to make their vision of life turn into a reality. They always seem to come up with ideas that others at first find strange but later realize are actually quite brilliant. Even if nobody else understands their point of view, Llamas have good instincts and know which ideas to defend and when to fight for them.

Llamas are lucky in that many of their seemingly conflicting characteristics tend to balance out well together. They can appear relaxed while anxious, confident while insecure, carefree while focused, and delicate while strong. Sure, they can have occasional outbursts of frustration and indignation - just as their animal namesake has been known to spit in the faces of others when they are behaving in a way the llama doesn’t like - but these are rarely seen by others. This only adds to their natural ability to intrigue others without having to appear moody or mysterious.
