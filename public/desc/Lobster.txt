The life of a person born under the sign of Lobster can be complex and emotional - but only on the inside. Like their animal namesake, members of this sign rarely show the chaos that goes on in their minds to anyone other than their closest, most trusted friends. That’s not to say that a Lobster’s life is chaotic. In fact, most people born under this sign are highly organized and are the first to volunteer their help for a friend or family member’s project. They want others to see them as bright and capable, which they in fact are, but they also have a great deal of self-doubt that shows up through a polite quietness.

Lobsters may be soft on the inside, but they cover their fragility up with a hard exterior. This isn’t the type of tough and spirited shell that some others signs hide behind, but rather a gentleness that suggests that nothing could possibly bother them. Sometimes people mistake this quality for thinking that they don’t care, but in fact few people care more about those close to them than the Lobster. This is a creative and indulgent sign that can be hard to get to know at first. They can be contradictory at times, as what’s going on inside their hearts and minds doesn’t always match the image that they show others. Those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of Lobster will have to learn to come out of their shells and allow others to see their imperfections if they want to find peace and serenity in life.
