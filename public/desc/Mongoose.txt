In the animal kingdom the mongoose is famous for taking on venomous snakes - a feat that few animals have the skills or bravery to do. This is an apt metaphor for those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Mongoose. Members of this sign are strong-willed, rebellious, and unafraid of standing up for themselves. It is, perhaps, with these traits that the Mongoose is most unique, though they also tend to have a mysterious quality that exceeds their reputation of leading with their heart before their head.

Mongooses are impulsive and adventurous and believe in doing what is best for the world as they see it. They tend to have strong opinions about not just what’s right and what’s wrong, but how things should be. They are deep, intelligent, and often intense thinkers that stand up for what they believe in, regardless of the consequences. Mongooses would rather be hated than be phony, and some signs that can’t handle their opinionated nature have a hard time not being offended by their outspoken intensity.



Though they are not afraid of a fight, Mongooses are actually very optimistic. They don’t like dwelling on the past and prefer to focus on what they can do to create a better future. They stay busy because they are easily frustrated by having to wait for results and because they can’t stand being bored. Being bored and stagnant in life is the worst curse for a member of this sign. They are very much doers, and deep down they feel that action in some form or another is required of them. Their high idealism can lead to depression if they don’t learn to be patient and live life’s journey regardless of the results. In order to maintain balance in life, Mongooses must also learn which emotions to hold onto and which to let go of. Learning to pick their battles and give themselves some well-deserved rest is important to their health and well-being.
