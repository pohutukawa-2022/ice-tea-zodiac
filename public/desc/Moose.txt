Quiet, observant, and gentle, those born under the sign of the Moose are hard workers who dedicate themselves to the causes that they believe in. These causes may be the family they choose to raise or the careers they choose to follow, but in most cases they move selflessly toward the greater good.

Moose are sensitive, but this should not be misinterpreted as a weakness. Like their animal namesake, their generally calm and submissive nature is offset by the knowledge that they have great strength in reserve and can become as aggressive as anyone if pushed too far. Those who try to take advantage of them will find this out the hard way.



While not particularly social by nature, Moose like to surround themselves with familiar faces and warm, cozy, comfortable surroundings. They are kind and caring friends and family members who give of themselves freely. They may have big dreams, but more than anything Moose crave a happy, peaceful life. Often preferring to spend time at home than out in society, members of this sign usually have nice homes filled with nice things. They appreciate the subtleties of art and aesthetics and usually have excellent, if not eccentric taste.

Moose not only seek peace and comfort, but also unique ideas and unusual roles. They don’t take a lot of risks, rather they will volunteer to try new things as long as they know that the consequences of things going wrong is minor. Moose have a somewhat hidden sense of pride. Above all, they don’t want to look foolish. They work hard to earn the respect of others and don’t risk losing that respect without good reason.
