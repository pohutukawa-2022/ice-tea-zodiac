Unique, romantic, and resilient, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Narwhal are capable of achieving great things. Narwhals typically have a calm and care-free exterior, but inside they are bursting with ideas, passion, and a drive for success. What should be a combination of two contradictory signs is instead a marriage of personality traits that help balance each other out. The warm and immediate nature of the Tiger warms up Virgo’s tendency to close themselves off to others, and Virgo’s observant and analytical nature help keep the Tiger’s unpredictable and impulsive nature in check.

Like their animal namesake, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of Narwhal prefer for life to move slowly, though they can be surprisingly quick and dangerous when challenged. In truth, members of this sign are rebels. Though they may not like this label, Narwhals are born to fight for what they believe in and are highly sensitive to both personal and social injustice.

Inner conflict often comes with the intense drive to achieve and succeed battling the inner need for rational, intelligent planning. A recipe for frustration, members of this sign can be extremely intense when they finally get moving on a project, and it is often best to let them work alone. Achieving balance in life should be the number one goal of this sign. It will be challenging for Narwhals to overpower and quiet down their ever moving mind, but only those who do will find a new focus and clarity that can help them achieve the greatness that they have always dreamed of.
