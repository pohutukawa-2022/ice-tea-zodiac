As it is with their animal namesake, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Orca have no natural predators. Astrologically speaking, they represent the very top of the food chain in terms of leadership, respect, and pride. While they are truly warm-hearted, energetic, and capable of all kinds of success, they also tend to have highly inflated egos.

Orcas know they they were born under a fortunate sign, and fully expect a life full of adventure, mystery, drama, and excitement. They also expect to be highly respected, to the point of being worshipped. Thus, it’s easy for this powerful and majestic sign to lose sight of what’s really important in life. For all the immense good a Orca is capable of, many lose perspective on the contributing side of their nature, particularly when they feel they are not being given the reverence and appreciation they are due.

Life is supposed to be a grand adventure for this King of the Zodiacs. When there is no drama, they will invent it. When they have no enemies to challenge them, they will create some. When everything is going just fine, they will find a reason why it needs changed. At the same time, when there are real threats and adventures in their lives, this is a sign that should embrace and conquer them as their nature intends. One of the key life purposes of a Orca is understanding that reverence and respect is earned, not their birthright. Those who can accept and adopt this way of thinking will become virtually unstoppable in life. More than any other sign, Orcas need a purpose in life with goals to pursue.
