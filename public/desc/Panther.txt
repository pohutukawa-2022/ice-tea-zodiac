Panthers are one of the most well-liked of the Primal Zodiac signs. They are very engaging with others and are always looking for ways to make life better for everyone around them. When they are on top of their game, they are strong, energetic, creative, and intelligent. But they have a dark side, which usually comes out if they feel like they are not in control of their lives. When they are off balance, they can also be eccentric, over-protective, mysterious, and unpredictable.

No matter what their current mood, Panthers are confident, and they have every reason to be. They are smart, creative thinkers with excellent leadership and social skills. They can be overbearing at times when they want things done their way, but most of the time others recognize that their ideas are good and that their hearts are in the right place. Paired with their natural charm, it’s hard not to want to do things a Panther’s way.


Balance is key for members of this sign. They have big ideas and thrive on accomplishment, but this can cause them to miss out on the more important things in life. They work very hard and stay focused on their goals, but this can cause them to burn out, especially if they don’t get the results they have worked so hard for. When this happens, the dark side comes out and they become moody, mean-spirited, and aloof - they exact opposite of their usual nature. Even their closest friends will be put off by this sudden change in temperament. Luckily, they tend to bounce back reasonably well and should soon be back on course toward their next goal.
