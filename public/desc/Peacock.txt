Those born under the sign of the Peacock have, more often than not, larger-than-life personalities. They are witty, confident, and have a flair for the dramatic. Peacocks love attention, and for this reason they often like to start drama or controversy. They are highly social and have little desire to spend time alone. Being out and about is where they shine, as is performing whatever task it is that they excel at. Success is important to this sign, and Peacocks love to share (and show-off) their success by treating friends to take part in the spoils of their life victories.

Like their animal namesake, Peacocks live to be admired. They may feign modesty from time to time, but they are very aware that they have an uncanny magnetism that attracts both attention and praise. Members of this sign like to look good, feel good, and be on top. They consider themselves winners in all they do and because of this, they are usually right. To witness a Peacock doing what they do best is to witness confidence personified. They truly believe that they deserve all of the attention and praise they get, and have a very hard time understanding the occasions where they donâ€™t get it.

The biggest weakness of this sign is that they rely heavily on others to fulfill their emotional needs. Peacocks have a deep-seeded need to be proven right all the time. They also need to be loved, admired, and praised. While most people can go through life with occasional reminders of respect and admiration by others, Peacocks cannot. They need to be reminded on a regular basis that they are special, and as big as their egos may be, they cannot rely on their self-worth alone to fill this need. For such a strong, independent sign, Peacocks can be brought down in the simplest way - by being ignored.
