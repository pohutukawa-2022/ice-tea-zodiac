In nature, the Piranha is a small but powerful with razor sharp teeth and a hunger to consume whatever is foolish enough to get in its way. In human society, members of the Piranha Primal Zodiac sign aren't all that different. They are fearless, aggressive, and get what they want every time. They are highly career-oriented and use their charm and high energy levels to push forward consistently. Piranhas have an over-sized appetite for success that is never satisfied. They have the smarts and the will to do whatever it takes to get ahead, and they often do.

This is not to say that Piranhas are unlikable. In truth, they usually have many friends and are fiercely loyal to their families. They are self-sufficient enough to not need anyone else, though, and when they find that others don’t have the drive to succeed they will move on all by themselves. Members of this sign are as popular as they choose to be, but they also make many enemies. While they are mostly in control of every situation, they sometimes lash out at others unnecessarily and can be excessively mean spirited. After they have cooled down, though, don’t expect a Piranha to apologize for their behavior. Instead they will walk away blaming you for the whole event.
