In the animal kingdom, the pit bull is often seen as a strong and potentially dangerous creature that can be very protective of those close to them. Why is it then, that so many people choose the pit bull as a pet?

As it is with the animal, those born under the sign of the Pit Bull can be mercurial, defensive, and hard to read from a distance, but those close to them know that few people are as loyal, kind-hearted, and family-oriented as the Pit Bull. This can be a challenging sign to get to know well, as they rarely let those they don’t know well get too close. They aren’t outwardly aggressive, but more defensive by nature. A Pit Bull will fight to the death to defend its friends and family with relentless vigor. They believe strongly in justice and fairness and do not hesitate to step in when a situation is out of balance.

Pit Bulls are mostly serious by nature and tend to keep to themselves. Inside they are highly emotional and have trouble finding balance and peace in their lives. They are constantly on guard, trying to protect their surprisingly fragile emotions as well as the honor of their friends and family. Members of this sign can be so tormented by their inner turmoil that they can become painfully self-absorbed. They they don’t often show it on the outside, they live in an internal sea of confusion and uncertainty, and are almost never completely relaxed.
