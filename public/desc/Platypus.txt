There is no question that the platypus is one of the most unique and difficult to comprehend animals in the world, so there should be little surprise that people born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Platypus find themselves in a similar situation. Shy, hard working, and sensitive, those born under this sign often feel that they don’t quite belong in whatever society they have been brought up in.

Platypuses do best around intuitive individuals, who understand that which is not being said out loud - the reservations with others, the fear of betrayal and rejection, the need to plan things out before acting. Members of this sign do well with intuitive types because they can still communicate without having to explain themselves. It doesn’t even matter if these others are like them or not in terms of physicality, social groups, or approach to life.



Very intelligent and hard working, many Platypuses have personalities which seem old for their age. They are most often quiet and reserved and don’t enjoy standard social events that their peers seem to be excited about. Instead, they are often interested in obscure subjects and understanding the core aspects of how life works. They may feel like outcasts, but will later find out that everyone is different on purpose, and they most likely chose the Platypus approach to life in order to gain deep wisdom and knowledge that otherwise fade into the background in the lives of others.

Of course, all of these traits can be offset with certain signs in the birth chart (such as having the Moon or Ascendant in Gemini), which will give an entirely different spin on how this personality relates to the outside world. Collecting the finer details of each individual is more important for this sign than many others simply because of the strong effect each planetary aspect can have on the direction of each individual life.
