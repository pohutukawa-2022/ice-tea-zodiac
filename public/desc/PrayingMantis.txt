The Praying Mantis is the master manipulator of the Primal Zodiac. Those born under this sign have a gift for convincing others to do whatever they want them to. Like their animal namesake, members of this sign prefer to blend into the background and wait for their prey to come to them. Thatâ€™s not to say that Praying Mantises are evil or even ill-intentioned. They simply have the power to get others to do things that benefit them. Used for good, this is a rare and powerful skill set that can accomplish much more when shared with others than it could when Praying Mantises go it alone.

As you might expect, members of this sign are charming, charismatic, and energetic. They are hard to ignore, which is fine because most who meet them would have no reason to want to ignore them anyway. They are well-mannered and intriguing on the outside, but aggressive and even possessive on the inside. Once a Praying Mantis discovers his or her power of persuasion, it may become hard for them to control their desire to wield it. As it is in most superhero comics, it takes time to master a powerful gift, and in that time the student may choose to use their powers to help others or to serve themselves.
