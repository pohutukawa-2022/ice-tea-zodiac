Warm, colorful, and gregarious, those born under the sign of the Quetzal have personalities that are hard to ignore. Interestingly, they are not the loudest or most outspoken members of a given group, yet they are often the most popular. Quetzals seem to have some kind of magical “x-factor” - an indescribable trait about themselves that draws others to them, and draws success to their lives.

It is not unusual for well-known Quetzals to have a different public or occupational persona than they do in private. It’s as if they can split their personalities into two parts - the bright, outgoing celebrity that takes everything in stride, and the quiet, thoughtful, funny, and generous person they feel comfortable being with those they know. Somehow this rarely comes across as phony, as both sides of their distinct personalities are genuinely a part of who they really are.

Though they can be gentle and easy-going, members of this sign are surprisingly able to succeed where most others fail. It’s not that they are necessarily strong-willed like some other signs, rather they simply choose not to see the obstacles in their way. Quetzals see what they want and don’t stress about the details. Instead they proceed step by step, day by day, until they have achieved goals bigger than anyone else thought possible.
