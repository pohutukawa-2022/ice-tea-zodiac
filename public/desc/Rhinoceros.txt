How do you stop a charging Rhinoceros? You don’t. You run like heck and don’t look back. People born under the sign of Rhinoceros are strong, determined, aggressive, and never back down from a challenge. Though this impetuousness occasionally gets them into trouble, members of this sign usually come out of battle victorious. They are both brave and lucky, as if blessed somehow by fate to constantly fight and constantly win.

For better or worse this is probably the most fearless sign in the Primal Zodiac, which fits perfectly with their desire for action and love of adventure. Not conformists by nature, they would probably run off and live in the wild if it didn’t mean they would be alone most of the time. Despite their aggressive nature, Rhinos crave social interaction, especially when it involves them telling stories of their great adventures to anyone who will listen.
