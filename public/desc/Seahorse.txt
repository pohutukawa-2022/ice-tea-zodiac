In the animal kingdom, seahorses have a surprisingly hard exterior. This heavy armor both protects them from danger and weighs them down. These sea creatures end up spending a great deal of time and energy anchoring themselves to the sea floor to avoid being swept away by passing tides and currents. Similarly, those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Seahorse will always choose survival first, even if it slows them down from getting where they want to go.

Seahorses are unique individuals. From the outside they can be a bit hard to understand. Often the exterior you see will not match the person inside. Usually portraying a tough but charming persona, Seahorses are often internally insecure. As much armor as they put up, they still need love and encouragement from others, but they think it makes them look weak to admit it. In fact, members of this sign rarely ever talk about themselves or share their troubles, yet they are among the best at listening and giving good advice. Such seeming contradictions are part of the intrigue and mystery of this powerful sign.



It is very important for Seahorses to think of themselves as self-reliant, which they are, but they also need to admit when they need help, which they won’t do. Instead, those born under this sign would rather slowly and steadily crawl toward their goals than risk appearing incapable or needy. Interestingly it is often their independent successes that give them the confidence to progress in life. Over time, each Seahorse will need to figure out that by accepting assistance from others, they can actually make it much farther in life. Those who don’t may face a great deal of frustration, difficulty, and anxiety.

At their best, Seahorses will find a balance in life that will allow them to reach their goals without burning themselves out. At their worst the fear of lacking money or success can take over, making them greedy, narrow-minded, judgmental, and self-pitying.
