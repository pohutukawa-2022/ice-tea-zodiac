If there is one word that defines people born under the sign of the Seal it is “excitement”. This is a sign that needs to be mentally challenged on a regular basis. Whether that challenge comes from studying their latest favorite subject or simply trying to outwit others, these are highly social individuals that always have a lot going on. Seals are know-it-alls, but not because they care to impress others, they simply love facts and love to talk, so naturally they often have a lot to share. If you have a friend that loves to gossip, loves to talk about the latest news story, or constantly sends you memes, there's a good chance that person is a Seal. 

With all of their vast knowledge and ability to figure out new things quickly, others are often surprised at how disorganized and messy a Seal can be. Members of this sign absolutely hate being bogged down with maintenance tasks such as cleaning, paying the bills, or even reading all of their mail. If a Seal exercises it is because they like the expression of energy and the way it makes them feel, not because they should be doing it for their health.

Seals are very intelligent, but can have a hard time fitting into society. They aren't rebels, they just want to live each moment when it comes. The worst thing in the world for this sign is the possibility of missing out on a unique experience. To Seals, the world is a fascinating place with endless mysteries to explore. Boredom is like a prison for them, where they feel trapped and desperate to break out. Luckily they stay busy and social enough to avoid feeling bored most of the time.
