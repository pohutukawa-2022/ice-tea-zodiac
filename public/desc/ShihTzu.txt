The name “shih tzu” literally means “Lion Dog” in Chinese, so it’s only natural that those born under the Primal Zodiac sign of the Shih Tzu share the Tropical Sun sign of Leo, and are born during the Chinese Zodiac’s Year of the Dog.

Members of this sign are kind, loving, and generous. Their deepest hope is to play an integral role in making their surroundings better. This is almost always appreciated by others, but Shih Tzus also have a tendency to become bossy and can become moody to the point of acting childish if they don’t get to be in charge (though minor signs in the birth chart may affect this differently). Over time, Shih Tzus learn that they will eventually get what they want if they focus on giving instead of receiving. Still, this is a sign that at the very least needs the adoration of those they are helping in order to feel good about all they are giving. They have a strong sense of justice and if they feel that they are being treated with less respect or appreciation than they deserve, they will shun the offender and punish them by withdrawing their own help and attention until an apology is made (or enough time passes that they forgive and forget, which they do quite easily).

This is very honest sign who values integrity more than most. Those who are dishonest or disrespectful with them will be cut off without a second thought. Unfortunately Shih Tzus can also be a bit paranoid from time to time, thinking that others are plotting against them, but they also have good instincts and should learn to withhold judgment (or revenge) by balancing their intuition with the facts at hand.
