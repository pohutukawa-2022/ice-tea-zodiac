A combination of the two most passive signs in their respective zodiacs, the Primal Zodiac sign of Silkworm belongs to those born under the tropical sun sign of Pisces during the Chinese Year of the Rabbit. This should not be interpreted, though, as saying that the Silkworm is weak. Members of this sign are among the most creative and intuitive people in the world. The difference between a weak or a strong Silkworm will be the amount of self-confidence they build. Silkworms are very emotional and easily influenced, so having strong role-models around, particularly in their younger and more formative years, will make a tremendous difference.

While this combination may be sensitive and emotional, they are also capable of creating great things. When they are feeling good, there are few who can match the creative power of their minds. They have the ability to see things in an entirely unique way, and thus are capable of great innovations. Just look at the lifeâ€™s work of fellow Silkworm Albert Einstein for proof.



The good thing is that the natural serenity of the Rabbit eases the inherent tendency of Pisces to become overly worked up while questioning everything in life. Kindness and compassion are very important to this sign; so much so that they have a tendency to give too much too often and find themselves worn down and burnt out. In nature, silkworms do not survive in the wild. They must be carefully raised and bred by humans, and eventually give their lives for the beautiful and delicate silk that they produce. This is an apt metaphor for those born under the sign of the Silkworm. Though they may seem too delicate to survive the rigors of the outside world, members of this sign must be able to grow beyond themselves to create the beauty that they alone are able to. Silkworms will give anything and everything for what they believe in, which to some seems like too much, but to them seems to be the very purpose of their existence.
