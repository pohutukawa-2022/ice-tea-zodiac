Usually being called a Snail means that you are slow moving, but if your Primal Zodiac sign happens to be the Snail it means much more than that. Members of this sign are deep thinkers and are extremely devoted to those they love. They are very difficult people to predict. They tend to be moody and spend a lot of time alone pondering the mysteries of life. The intuitive senses of this sign are strong, and some Snails may find they even have a sixth sense or psychic ability.

While they may ask you many questions about your life, Snails don’t like to reveal a lot about themselves. Ironically they can see through the facades of others yet they still put up a facade of their own. Deep down they are insecure and worried that others won’t accept them for who they really are. Snails may seem cool and reserved on the outside, but inside they are very sensitive and highly emotional. They feel things on a deeper level than most other signs, but they never let it show. Members of this sign will need to learn how to let others help them if they are going to grow both emotionally and spiritually.
