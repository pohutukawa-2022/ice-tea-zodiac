Gentle, philosophical, and adventurous, those born under the sign of the Sugar Glider are not interested in aggressive behavior or confrontation. Instead, they prefer to enjoy the world on their own terms. Sugar Gliders long for new experiences in life and get bored with routine fairly quickly. They don’t need the drama that some other signs crave, preferring to relax, explore, and wander at their leisure.

This is a sign that is full of opposites, some contradictory and some complimentary. Despite their enjoyment of new experiences they also like spending a lot of time at home. They are clever and ambitious, capable of accomplishing almost anything, yet they are very specific about what they do and do not want to do. Often they will start projects just to abandon them when something more interesting comes along.



Like their animal namesake, those born under the sign of the Sugar Glider like to stay up late at night, even if they are just relaxing. They are playful with their own people but are considerably more wary of outsiders. There is a tendency to grow attached to those they spend the most time with and they often become depressed if they don’t get enough social time.

Sugar Gliders are one of the luckier signs in general, but they have a particularly lucky streak with money. Though they may not be rich, they almost always have money when they need it. They aren’t big investors, in fact they enjoy instant satisfaction a bit too much, especially when it comes to buying nice clothes, cars, and items for the home. Sugar Gliders hate routine and need more destination vacations than the average person, though making a concrete decision on where to go is not one of their strengths.
