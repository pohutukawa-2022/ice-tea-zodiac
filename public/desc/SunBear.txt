Those born under the sign of the Sun Bear are something of a contradiction. On one hand they are funny, outgoing, warm, and upbeat, but just as often are serious, overly hard-working, determined, and even stubborn. They are excellent in social situations, able to charm with ease and speak with great authority. Sun Bears are natural leaders who command the respect of even their most bitter of detractors.

Members of this sign struggle to live a balance between these two very distinct sides of their personalities. It seems that only when they are working towards a goal do they feel balanced, so they tend to work long, hard hours in order to try to make things right. This is an optimistic sign that believes that what you give will be returned to you, so for the most part they try to stay positive at all times. Showing weakness is not part of their nature, so donâ€™t expect them to back down from a challenge.

Though socially adept and charming, Sun Bears do most of their best work lost in their own thoughts. Like their animal namesake, members of this sign have a solitary, stoic quality that seems somewhat out of character. This deep, personal thinking, however, is where their deep connection to their passion and personal ideals stems from. It is critically important to the balance of a Sun Bear that they take this time to themselves to recharge themselves for another day in the spotlight of the world.
