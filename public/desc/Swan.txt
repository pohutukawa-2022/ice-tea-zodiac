Talk about a contradiction in terms, those born under the sign of the Swan are confident, beautiful, and elegant from a distance, but hiding inside is anxiety, uncertainty, and a mind that constantly wanders. It is this very inner-drama, though, that makes the life of a Swan interesting and compelling. A creative, multi-talented group of people, members of this sign are perhaps destined for stardom more than others, but it’s their inner imbalance that keeps them constantly checking themselves. Even those who become legitimate celebrities are more concerned with the quality of their work over fame and fortune.

Members of this sign are socially gifted and most people they meet assume that they are extremely self-confident and highly aware of their talents and charm, but Swans are usually the first to doubt themselves and become paralyzingly indecisive. The irony is that they have no reason to feel this way, as the path to success is practically laying out in front of them if they would only stop second-guessing themselves long enough to just start walking on it.

Swans have an annoying habit of wanting to be in charge of situations but then becoming indecisive as to the next move to make. A big part of this sign’s personality simply wants to sit around and dream while someone else takes care of everything for them. It’s contradictory to their powerful external personalities, but Swans get very upset when things don’t work out the way they hoped, and usually take a while to bounce back before trying again.
