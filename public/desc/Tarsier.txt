Loyal, helpful, and creative, those born under the sign of the Tarsier are also some of the most sensitive individuals of the Primal Zodiac. Tarsiers spend much of their time lost in thought. They are both dreamers and idealists who would greatly prefer to live in an imaginary Utopia rather than have to suffer through the chaos and iniquity of the real world.

Tarsiers are highly sensitive, both emotionally and intuitively. They take the pains of the world around them personally. In fact, they are so deeply affected by the problems of others that they can become easily overwhelmed, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and even addiction. Members of this sign have a very strong sense of justice, and a dedication to trust and loyalty that is unmatched among their peers.

Because of their sensitive nature, it is not unusual for Tarsiers to seclude themselves from others for periods of time. This is not only time to recharge emotionally but also to work on one of their many creative projects. All Tarsiers are artistic, though some may not exercise this part of their nature until later in life. While they are very friendly and trustworthy, Tarsiers are not particularly outgoing. Still, many people are intrigued by them and so they usually find their place in a social scene. They play their role as the loyal and trustworthy friend and confidant well, though they are also known to be worriers and complainers who must take care not to allow themselves to be taken advantage of.
