Peaceful, reserved, and intelligent, those born under the sign of the Tortoise are eager for new experiences. Though they are highly amiable in most every situation, there is a hidden restlessness to them, like an underground volcano; eventually the tension requires a release. For those whose circumstances won’t let them simply roam the world as they please, small adventures will become more and more necessary.

Tortoises enjoy nature and usually have a place they like to go and relax, whether it be the woods, coast, mountains, desert, river, or whatnot. There is always somewhere new to explore even if members of this sign don’t make it out of their usual routine often enough. These trips don’t have to be elaborate, in fact most Tortoises like to take things slow. This is a philosophical sign that likes to ponder the mysteries of life. Spiritually and intellectually advanced, they are deep thinkers that also need time just to quietly observe all that which surrounds them.



Tortoise is a sign of good luck and good karma. Both Sagittarius and Sheep are considered lucky signs and the art of Feng Shui even suggests that images of tortoises in the home will bring one good luck. Their karma is usually positive due to the fact that they don’t hold grudges and don’t try to take what they don’t deserve.

Like the famous children’s fable of the Tortoise and the Hare tells us, slow and steady wins the race. The Tortoise, being the hero of this tale, shows the rest of us how all achievements are made one small step at a time. There is little emotion involved in the fictional reptile’s journey. He knows he is the underdog so he pushes along slowly and wins because his adversary counts him out before the race is over. Likewise, members of this sign take their time moving through life. They move ever forward with caution but not hesitation.
