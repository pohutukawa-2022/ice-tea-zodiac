Those born under the sign of Toucan are friendly and energetic. They love being around people and live for social gatherings. This is a very creative sign that loves to experience art as much as they like creating it. Members of this sign are somewhat contradictory, however. For one thing, they open themselves to their friends as good listeners, yet they are troubled by the problems of others. A Toucan will absorb the difficulties around them and internalize them. They also like to get involved in other people’s business yet they shy away from confrontations and conflicts that arise from this activity. Also contradictory, they prefer being in familiar places yet they long to explore the world.

Toucans love learning about different cultures and languages. They fantasize about traveling to distant lands and having new experiences, but in reality they get a bit uncomfortable being away from home for too long. Because of this, many members of this sign stay in their hometowns but research other cultures and countries tirelessly. Expect to see coffee table books on foreign art and history in your Toucan friend’s home.
