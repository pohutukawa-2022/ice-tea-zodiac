Like their animal namesake, those born under the sign of the Turtle often hide within their own shell, coming out only when they feel safe. This is a quiet, reserved sign, at least on the outside. Turtles care for their friends and family with great intensity. They are usually well put-together and organized and are far more capable than most people give them credit for.

Members of this sign desire to live a simple and happy life. They don’t need fame and fortune to be happy, they just need to be close to friends and family and maybe have some nice things as well. Turtles like to dress well and keep their homes nice and neat. This is where they spend most of their money, considering having a nice home and nice clothes the height of their ambitions.

Turtles aren’t without their complexities, though. Because of their reserved nature they can be hard to get to know. They often hide a secret artistic talent, even from their own families. That’s because Turtles are very sensitive. They don’t want to be judged by others, let alone subject their innermost expressions to such judgment. Members of this sign don’t like to show their emotions, though they are also not great at hiding them.
