Tyrannosaurus Rex needs no introduction. Not the dinosaur nor the person. Members of the T-Rex sign are impossible not to notice. Their very presence dominates every situation they are a part of, from social gatherings to a day at the office.

Not surprisingly, Tyrannosaurus Rex are very polarizing. People either absolutely worship them or hate their guts. Not that a T-Rex would care, let alone notice. They tend to be very self-involved, yet carry a sureness and a charm that others admire. They are natural leaders, and they know it. Both the dinosaur and the person are on the top of their respective food chains and have no intention of giving up that power.

This sign is the most aggressive and demanding of all the Primal Zodiac signs. They can be absolutely tyrannical, as the name suggests, if they don’t have control over every situation. They are extremely capable of success and love proving it by overcoming challenge after challenge. They cannot be stopped, simply because they believe they cannot be stopped. They are used to getting what they want, and if they don’t, they shrug it off and move on.
