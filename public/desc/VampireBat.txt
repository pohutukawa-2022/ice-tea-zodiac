The name sounds scary, but like their animal namesake, people born under the sign of Vampire Bat are mostly harmless. I said mostly. They will tirelessly fight on behalf of their friends and family, and if you are considered an enemy, expect a Vampire Bat to keep attacking until one of you is finished. Members of this sign are highly emotional and take any perceived slight very personally. They are extraordinarily intense and very confident. They consider themselves the protectors of those close to them, which makes it much better to either be as close or as far away as possible from a Vampire Bat.

Deep down Vampire Bats just want to be loved and accepted. They are surprisingly giving to those they care about, and will go out of their way to make someone feel special and loved. They arenâ€™t fearless, but they act like it. They want to be admired and seen as leaders, but sometimes their emotions get the best of them and they have trouble containing their feelings.

Members of this sign are challenging to understand because they are so complex. They can be adventurous, eccentric, and on top of the world one day and depressed, jealous, and downright mean-spirited the next. They regularly let their emotions lead them, and will struggle throughout their lives to learn to calm down and think things through before reacting. Achieving balance is the key to their long-term happiness.
