Those born under the sign of the Wombat are strong, determined, sensitive, and stubborn. While they may not show their sensitive side to others, it is there - hidden beneath a layer of friendly manners they always keep on the surface. Wombats tend to be rather quiet and unsociable until you get to know them, or rather, until they get to know you. Members of this sign prefer to quietly observe until they feel comfortable with the group. Once you get them going, though, this is actually quite a social sign that gets along well with many different types of people.

Wombats are smarter, stronger, and more agile than others expect. This sign can be painfully over-indulgent and procrastinating to the point that others wonder how it is they get by day to day. Once a Wombat has made up its mind, however, there is nothing that can stop them from getting what they want. This is where their slow determination and stubborn refusal to let anything stop them give them their great strength.

Wombats prefer familiar people and places. They are fond of luxuries and usually have well-kept homes where they enjoy hosting parties. A Wombat will always have great food, wine, and desserts on hand, as they do like to indulge in worldly pleasures a bit too much. Hosting parties and entertaining guests is where they shine the most. They prefer this very strongly over going out to clubs or bars or anywhere else loud or crowded.
