Sincere, dependable, and a bit eccentric, those born under the sign of the Zebra walk to their own beat. It’s not that they try to be noticed, it’s just that people can’t help but notice them. Like the zebra of the animal kingdom, their authentic but unique way of being gives them a mysterious, attractive quality that is difficult to both understand and resist.

Zebras are social creatures who typically have many acquaintances. Though they can be fairly quiet and reserved they are actually excellent networkers. They can simply walk politely through a room introducing themselves and have half of the room wanting to find out more about them. Though they are friendly with many people, they sometimes have a hard time forming deep relationships with people because they spread themselves too thin trying to keep too many friendships going at once. They simply run out of time to give to others.



Those born under this sign don’t just know a lot of people, they also know a little bit about a lot of different things. Zebras follow what they are attracted to most, which means that they will drop one project in favor of another one with little remorse. Should members of this sign find an interest that they want to stick with, it will most likely be something of an artistic, charitable, or social nature.

Many Zebras are drawn toward charity or social work as they have an inert ability to feel the pain of others. They are sincere in their desire to make the world a better place, but unlike some other signs, they have a hard time knowing exactly what to do about it. Zebras are not the types to start non-profit organizations, but they are the types to donate, volunteer, or work under the guidance of an Executive Director. Zebras may lead by example, but they are not usually considered leaders by themselves or their peers. They have too difficult of a time making decisions (especially under time restraints) and dealing with conflicts to play anything but a supporting role.
